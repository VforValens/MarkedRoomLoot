# Welcome to Make Marked Room Loot Good Again

This project is designed to make marked room loot good again. 

Currently in a work-in-progress status. 

Please expect bugs as well as possibly overpowered loot as I adjust the mod to a balanced state.

Any bugs, or suggestions you have should be reported via the [issues tracker](https://github.com/VforValens/MarkedRoomLoot/issues). Thanks!
